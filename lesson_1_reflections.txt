How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it helped me as it showed what is the different lines in the two versions savingme alot of time searching the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

it help us to keep track of what we have done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

auto save will leads to alot of unwanted saved files may be not working files so manually is best solution thier by saving or committing at every logical change will do the job.
